 ABSTRACT:
                Accounts pertaining to banks, organizations, applications and accounts - all of these need to be monitored  during the creation of accounts and suspicious creation ought to be reported using data comparison. Doing such a process manually going through logs on a continuous basis is not a viable option for an individual to do so and hence yet another scenario that was made for an RPA based software robot to take up.


Module Split-up:
1.Designing the clone Web page of Particular Organization.(Prabu.M)   
2.Data entry.(Kathiresan.s)
3.Pattern matching (Data sets).(Marimuthu.K)
4.Reporting and sending the mail.(Kathiresan.s)


PROPOSED SYSTEM:
The Humans are under the era of committing the mathematical and parallax errors while in terms of the RPA the errors are very low.
The work can be done faster and efficient from man-hours and man-years to Minutes and Seconds
The removal of duplicate and checking whether the details are valid is automatic.


ADVANTAGES:
In Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is the use of software with capabilities to handle high-volume, repeatable tasks that previously required a human to perform. 
This technology increases the productivity for human employees who no longer are tasked with boring work.
It will increses the productivitiy time and reduce cost in the system.
